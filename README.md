### About this data
Each quarter the U.S. Department of Defense releases data on military property transfers to police agencies throughout the United States.

Agencies can request surplus data from the Defense Logistic Agency's Law Enforcement Support Office. Agencies can request items as small as bandages and as large as mine-resistant vehicles or aircraft. The items are released at no cost to law enforcement agencies. 

Investigative Reporters & Editors is making this data available as a public service to journalists covering police agencies throughout the United States. The data is freely available from the [Department of Defense](https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/Offers/Reutilization/LawEnforcement/PublicInformation/) but the nature of the Excel file can make it difficult to easily navigate.

The only work IRE has done is to combine these records into a single CSV file. There are other tables available at the web link above, including information about ammunition transfers as well as cancelled orders. If you find problems with this data, you will need to contact the Defense Logistic Agency for clarification.
